A fun frontend project going back to the roots of my childhood and the foundation of Web Dev, JavaScript. I had originally used an IIFE with vanilla JS, but had some limitations, so I decided to remake this project taking advantage of React.

I connected to an external API which allows you to search for any Pokémon within the database. I also made use of CSS to design my own modal whereas previously I used Bootstrap. I have the original code linked below, take a look at my progress.
